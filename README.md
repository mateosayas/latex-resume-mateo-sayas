# latex-resume-mateo-sayas

My professional resume built with LaTeX using XeLaTeX. Features a modular structure with separate files for work experience, education, and skills, styled with FontAwesome icons and custom formatting commands.

## Build

Requires [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) or any TeX Live distribution.

```bash
xelatex main.tex
```

## Structure

- `main.tex` -- Main document with contact info and profile
- `work.tex` -- Work experience
- `academic.tex` -- Education
- `skills.tex` -- Technical skills
- `img/` -- Profile photo
